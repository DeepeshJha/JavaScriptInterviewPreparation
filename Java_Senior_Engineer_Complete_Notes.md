# Java Senior Engineer Complete Notes

## Introduction to Java
- **Overview of Java**: Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).
- **Java vs JavaScript**: Despite the similar names, Java and JavaScript are two distinct languages. Java is a statically typed, compiled language, while JavaScript is a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

## Basic Syntax
- **Variables and Data Types**: Java has several data types, including primitive types (int, boolean, char, etc.) and reference types (objects).
- **Control Structures**: 
  - `if`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
  - Functions in Java are defined within classes as methods.

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- **Classes and Objects**: The fundamental building blocks of Java.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Mechanisms to create a new class based on an existing class.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary parts.

## Collections Framework
- **Lists, Sets, Maps**: Java provides several data structures to store collections of objects.
- **Comparison**: Java's collections can be mapped to JavaScript objects and arrays based on their functionality.

## Exception Handling
- **Try, Catch, Finally**: Mechanisms to handle runtime errors gracefully.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating user-defined exceptions for better error handling.

## Java Streams and Lambda Expressions
- **Functional Programming**: Introduced in Java 8, allows for more concise code.
- **Comparison**: Similarities with JavaScript's Promises and Async/Await for handling asynchronous operations.

## Java Annotations
- **Understanding Annotations**: Metadata that provides data about a program but is not part of the program itself.
- **Comparison**: Similar to decorators in JavaScript.

## Concurrency in Java
- **Threads and Runnable**: Java's way of handling multiple threads of execution.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring that two or more concurrent processes do not interfere with each other.

## Best Practices and Design Patterns
- **Common Design Patterns**: Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc.
- **Comparison**: How these patterns are used in Java vs JavaScript.

## Conclusion and Further Resources
- **Further Reading**: List of books, online resources, and documentation for deeper understanding.
